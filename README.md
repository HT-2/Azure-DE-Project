*Overview
This project implements an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Azure to analyze Olympic data. The pipeline covers data extraction, transformation, and storage using various Azure services.

*Components
**Azure Data Factory (ADF):
Responsible for data extraction from various sources (e.g., APIs, databases, files).
Orchestrates the entire pipeline.
Schedules data extraction jobs.

**Databricks:
Utilized for Spark-based data transformation.
Performs data cleaning, aggregation, and feature engineering.
Executes complex data processing tasks efficiently.

**Azure Data Lake Storage:
Serves as the data lake for storing raw and processed data.
Provides scalability, security, and flexibility.
Supports both structured and unstructured data.
Workflow

**Data Extraction:
ADF retrieves Olympic data from various sources (e.g., historical records, live feeds).
Data is ingested into the pipeline.

**Data Transformation:
Databricks processes the raw data.
Spark jobs handle data quality checks, join operations, and feature engineering.
Cleaned and transformed data is ready for analysis.

**Data Storage:
Processed data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage.
Organized by date, event, or other relevant dimensions.
Enables efficient querying and analytics.
